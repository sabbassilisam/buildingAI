# A smarter way to track (and manage) chronic diseases

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
The Smart Health Tracker is a wearable device designed to monitor vital signs and activity levels for individuals with chronic conditions. Created by a fashion enthusiast, it ensures that health monitoring does not compromise your style, seamlessly integrating into your outfits. It provides real-time data to both users and healthcare providers, aiming to enhance disease management and patient care through personalized insights and alerts.

## Background
* problem 1: Managing regular and accurate health monitoring can be a challenge for individuals with chronic diseases. 
* problem 2: Healthcare providers frequently have insufficient real-time data on their patients' daily health, which can impact the promptness of necessary interventions.
* problem 3: It is often challenging to find health-monitoring devices that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing, and that also complement various outfits. 
* personal motivation: My motivation comes from my father's struggle with chronic diseases and his difficulty finding a stylish health-monitoring device that fits well with his work attire. This inspired me to create a solution that combines both functionality and design.
* importance: Effective management of chronic diseases can prevent complications, reduce hospital visits, and enhance overall well-being. This project addresses a critical gap in continuous health monitoring while ensuring that individuals donâ€™t feel limited or self-conscious about their health condition. By integrating stylish design with functionality, it helps users feel confident and unrestricted in their daily lives.

## How is it used?
The Smart Health Tracker is a wrist-worn device that continuously monitors heart rate, blood pressure, physical activity, and sleep patterns. Users can track their health metrics via a companion mobile app, which also provides alerts and reminders for medication and appointments. Healthcare providers access consolidated data and insights through a secure dashboard, allowing for more informed and proactive management of patient care.

## Data sources and AI methods
* Data sources: The device collects data from sensors that measure vital signs and activity levels. Additional data may be collected through integration with electronic health records (EHRs) with user consent.
* AI Methods: Machine learning algorithms analyze patterns in the data to predict potential health issues, generate personalized health recommendations, and trigger alerts for anomalies.

## Challenges
* Ethical considerations: Protecting the privacy and security of sensitive health data is essential. Maintaining trust with users hinges on ensuring clear consent and transparency throughout the data handling process.
* Limitations: The device might not detect all health conditions or anomalies. Its data accuracy relies on the quality of the sensors and the user's adherence to proper usage guidelines.

## What next?
Future enhancements could involve broadening the range of health parameters monitored, integrating with additional health services, and utilizing advanced AI models for more accurate predictions. Developing these improvements will require expertise in AI development, hardware design, and data security.

## Acknowledgments
* Inspiration: Inspired by current wearable technology and the need for better chronic disease management tools, as well as a passion for fashion-forward designs that blend seamlessly with daily attire.
